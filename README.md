# Random Number Generator with Toast Notification

This project is a simple web application that generates a random number with a specified number of digits and provides an option to copy the number to the clipboard. It also displays a toast notification when the number is successfully copied.

## Features

- **Random Number Generation**: Select the number of digits (between 3 and 10) for the random number using a slider.
- **Clipboard Copy**: Click a button to copy the generated number to the clipboard.
- **Toast Notification**: A toast message is displayed when the number is copied, confirming the action.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structuring the content and layout.
- **CSS3**: Styling the user interface with transitions and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Handling the logic for generating numbers, copying to the clipboard, and displaying the toast notification.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will need a modern web browser to view and interact with the application. No additional installations are required.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/random-number-generator.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd random-number-generator
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser:

   - On macOS or Linux:

     ```bash
     open index.html
     ```

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     start index.html
     ```

## Usage

1. **Adjust the Slider**: Use the slider to select the number of digits for the random number. The range is from 3 to 10 digits.
   
2. **Generate the Number**: Click the "Generate" button to produce a random number with the specified number of digits. The generated number will be displayed in the designated paragraph.

3. **Copy to Clipboard**: Click the copy button (clipboard icon) next to the generated number. This action will copy the number to the clipboard.

4. **Toast Notification**: A toast message will appear at the bottom of the screen indicating that the number has been copied to the clipboard. The message disappears after 2 seconds.

## Code Explanation

### HTML Structure

- **Slider Input**: The `<input>` element with type `range` is used for selecting the number of digits. It has the attribute `data-slider-number` for easy access in JavaScript.

- **Paragraph for Result**: The `<p>` element with `data-result` attribute displays the generated random number.

- **Dialog for Toast**: The `<dialog>` element with `data-toast` attribute acts as a toast notification to provide feedback to the user when the number is copied.

### JavaScript Logic

- **Event Listeners**:
  - **Slider Change**: Updates the displayed number of digits dynamically as the slider is moved.
  - **Generate Button Click**: Generates a random number with the selected number of digits and updates the result paragraph.
  - **Copy Button Click**: Copies the displayed number to the clipboard using the Clipboard API and shows a toast notification.

- **Random Number Generation**:
  - A random number is generated by shuffling an array of digits and slicing it to match the selected number of digits.

- **Toast Notification**:
  - The `<dialog>` element is shown and hidden using its native `show()` and `close()` methods to display the toast notification.

### CSS Styling

- **Responsive Design**: Flexbox is used to center the content, ensuring the application looks good on various screen sizes.

- **Transitions**: CSS transitions are used to smoothly show and hide the toast notification.
